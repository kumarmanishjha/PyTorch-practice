Welcome to Rydesafely candidate assessment for role of **Applied ML Perception Researcher**/**ML Perception Engineer**. Before you attempt this assessment, keep in mind the following:
- The questions are purely intended to guage your coding style, software engineering and understanding of the most basic concepts.
- This is proprietary. You are not allowed to redistribute it in any manner.

Instructions on how to get this code up and running: 
The code is tested to run perfectly with python3.8.
- If you do not have it on your system, we highly recommend using *venv*. Install it by ```sudo apt install python3-venv```.
- Create a virtual environment using ```python3.8 -m venv env```
- Activate the virtual environment using ```source env/bin/activate```.
- Install the necessary dependencies using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
 

Questions for you:
- In the function *your_answer* in the script *question.py*, normalize *img* to [0-1].
- Continuing from the answer to the previous question, do convolution on *img* using *filterXX* with a unit padding on both the dimensions. Print on the console the feature map and its shape. 
- Again continuing from the answer to the previous question, do a *2X2 max-pool* operation on the feature map. Print on the console the output and its shape.


Making submissions:
- You can submit it zipping the whole folder except the virtual env directory if you made any, and sending it over by email to *sanjay@rydesafely.com* with a subject line as *Your name: Rydesafely coding assessment*.

Good luck!!
